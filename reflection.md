Monday night. 

- What are your initial impressions of Java? 

I am overwhelmed by the change in syntax and feel very underprepared for the future. 

- Can you draw any conclusion about programming in general from the similarities or the differences between the two languages? 

You have to be much more explicit in what you want java to do than python. 

- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?

I had to look up how to do things in java that i knew how to do in python - conceptially I would have a plan, but have no idea how to impliment it with the proper syntax or in a way that java would understand. For example, you cannot use " if ____ in ____" as you can in python.
